			Among the many reasons that make Indian food a popular 
			cuisine across the globe, one is the use of aromatic spices that make the meal an 
			absolute treat. Yes, it could also be hot and spicy for some, but if you can get past 
			that then you will find it hard to resist the various kinds of curries and stir-fries that grace the Indian table.

			Sushi
		</div>
		<p>
			Homemade sushi will never be at the level of sushi from the top sushi restaurants in NYC, but here’s where homemade sushi wins:
			You get to gorge yourself on a sushi FEAST for like $20, whereas a similar amount of sushi at a restaurant would cost a couple hundred. 
			Soooooo worth it, if you ask me.
